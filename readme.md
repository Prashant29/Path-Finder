Hii Guys,

This is Path Finder code between two cities which is Entered in MySQL database.
You can recursively find from Source city to Destination City including most possible paths.

For Ex.
Source City                   Destination City 
ABC                             PQR
PQR                             XYZ
XYZ                             MNO
XYZ                             GHF
PQR                             MNO
MNO                             WER
ABC                             XYZ



So Above is Database and now If We gonna find path from "ABC" to "MNO"

So it will Display like below.
ABC => PQR => XYZ => MNO
ABC => XYZ => MNO
ABC => PQR => MNO


So. Now you got it How it working.

Thanks
